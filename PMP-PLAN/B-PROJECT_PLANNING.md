### Scope
<p align="justify">
In order to define and control what work is or is not included in music recommendation system, project scope is identified to ensure that the project team and stakeholders have the same understanding of the project. Music recommendation system provides recommendations based on recorded information of the music on the users' preferences. These systems use information filtering techniques to process information and provide the user with potentially more relevant items. The intention of this system is not to create a big music recommender as our music recommendation is focussed on English songs only. Therefore this system is not for commercial use.
