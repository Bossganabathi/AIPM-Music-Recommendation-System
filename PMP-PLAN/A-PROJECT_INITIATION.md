# MUSIC RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

## A - PROJECT INITIATION

### Project Summary
<p align="justify">Nowadays, the availability of digital music is very abundant compared to the previous era, so to sort out all this digital music is very time consuming and causes information fatigue. Therefore, it is very useful to develop a music recommender system that can search music libraries automatically and suggest songs that are suitable for users. By using a music recommender system, the music provider can predict and then offer the appropriate songs to their users based on the characteristics of the music that has been heard previously. </p>

<p align="justify">These features can help to get a list of appropriate music from the popular music libraries based on music that has been heard previously. This makes the recommender system play an important role in maintaining the streaming music business. Music recommendations are done by looking for similarities from one music to another or by giving preference from one user to another. </p>
<br/>

### Project Objective
<p align="justify">The main objective of our music recommendation system is to provide suggestions to the users that fit the user's preferences. The analysis of the facial expression/user emotion may lead to understanding the current emotional or mental state of the user. </p>
