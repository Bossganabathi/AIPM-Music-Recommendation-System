### Deliverables:

#### Hardware Requirements:
Each group member use own laptop with different specifications to conduct the project. 

#### Software Requirements:
Our group use python programming language to train the intelligent module in recommendating music and React framework for designing website and user interface.

#### Intelligent System Outcome:
